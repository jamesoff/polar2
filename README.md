# Polar Clock for Pebble SDK2

I wanted to write a Polar clock watchface for my Pebble but found op12 on github had done one for it already. However, it was for SDK1 and he hadn't updated it, so to get a feel for Pebble development I've taken his code and written an SDK2 version.

Mine has the seconds on the outside, then minutes and hours. Currently, there is no configuration or alternative versions beyond "edit the code yourself" :)
